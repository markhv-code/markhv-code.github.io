    <h1>About Me!</h1>
    <div>
        As a young man, Mark Valdez enjoyed being a part of the Boy Scouts of America, receiving the most prestigious
        award in Scouting,
        at the age of 15 (only 1% of Scouts achieve). For the next two years after high school, Mark was a full-time
        representative for
        the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints in Los Angeles, California. During that time, he worked 11 hour
        days teaching life improvement lessons.
        After only three months, Mark was chosen to lead other groups of representatives in improving teaching and
        productivity techniques.
        Mark Valdez graduated from Brigham Young University—Hawaii, one of the nation’s most diverse universities. One
        of his projects,
        Mark edited website content for Vizzda, one of the largest commercial realty databases in South Florida.
        Afterwards, the Co-Founder of Vizzda said,
        “The students of this class not only exceeded my expectations by literally architecting the messaging and
        content of our new homepage, but the feedback
        your students offered was fantastic.” Mark is currently a volunteer at the Surfrider Foundation and is
        passionate about ocean preservation and protecting
        the environment.
